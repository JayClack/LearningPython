# LearningPython
Repository for tasks and simple programs created whilst learning the basic/advanced aspects of Python. Since I am already familiar with Python, this will be more focused on theory, advanced techniques/structures, and general things of that nature.

I am an Apprentice Automation Engineer, who is studying Embedded Systems and Robotics at Univeristy this year. Therefore, Git and other such topics should be useful to learn!
